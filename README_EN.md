# ChromeCtrlP
[Chrome Web Store link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-ctrlp/pebcgobhffpbcdobjepnhhhkmeokhojl).
Having tons of tabs open in the window? This plugin comes to save! Fast tab switching tools inspired by the famous [vim plugin CtrlP](http://www.bestofvim.com/plugin/ctrl-p/). Support fuzzy search for both English and Chinese pinyin (the pronunciation system for Chinese). 

## Usage
Usage: For Windows users: press Alt+P shortcut to launch the plugin. For Mac users: press Ctrl+P to launch. Type to match the tab name. Use arrow key to select. Press Return switching to that tab. 
>Note: if the shortcut not working, probably it's in conflict with existing system/browser keybindings. In such case, open chrome://extensions in a browser window, scroll all the way down, click the "Keyboard Shortcuts" to customize the shortcut.
